Introduction
Mushroom classification is crucial for food safety, as certain mushroom species are highly toxic. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical characteristics.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle as part of the Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 8. It includes various features of mushrooms, such as cap shape, color, and odor, which are used to predict the class ('edible' or 'poisonous').
